##  Requirements
- [Write Everywhere](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/92908/Windows) (required)  
- [Highway Sign Structures](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/113261/Windows)


###  Fonts

Australia uses Highway Gothic typeface, same as the US. It can be found [here](https://www.dafont.com/highway-gothic.font). Wide is most similar to the actual font.
For copyright reasons, fonts are not included in this mod and must be downloaded and installed manually.


####  How to install fonts
1. Download the required fonts from the Links. (**Fileformat needs to be .ttf**)
2. Go to your local CS:2 mods folder:  
`\Cities Skylines II\ModsData\Klyte45Mods\WriteEverywhere\fonts`
*(if the `fonts` folder does not exist, create it manually)*  
3. Place the `.ttf` files inside this folder. 
4. Start the game and load your city.  
5. Press the W Icon on the Top-Left. Go to **City Fonts**.  
6. Press the `+` Button and choose the `.ttf`.

##  Notes
- Write Everywhere signs may impact performance on weaker machines
- I've used the 'rural sign' asset from Highway Structures mod for the majority of templates, the overhead signs use the overhead Highway Structures. 
- Some of the miscellaneous templates are just using the 'font box' hidden under the ground. 
- Give way and roundabout signs can just be placed on the game yield sign.
- There is very little actual Australian themed assets but hopefully there will be support for it some day
